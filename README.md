### DermNet
Dermnet (www.dermnet.com) is a publicly available dataset of more than 23000 dermatologist-curated skin disease images. According to [1](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/af34/fc0aebff011b56ede8f46ca0787cfb1324ac.pdf), Dermnet organizes the skin diseases biologically in a **two-level** taxonomy. The bottom-level contains more than 600 skin diseases in a fine-grained granularity. The top-level contains **23** skin disease classes. Each of the top-level skin disease class contains a subcollection of the bottom-level skin diseases.
